# GitHub Repo Blurb & About Section

Use the following short description and "About" blurb when creating your GitHub repository.

## Repository name suggestion
`real-time-monitoring`

## Short description (one line)
Real-time monitoring system with AI-powered anomaly detection and trend prediction (Python, scikit-learn, Streamlit).

## About (longer blurb)
This project simulates real-time sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure), detects anomalies using Isolation Forest, and predicts future trends using Linear Regression. It includes an interactive Streamlit dashboard with Plotly visualizations, comprehensive documentation, and a GitHub Actions CI workflow. Ideal for portfolio showcasing full-stack data engineering and machine learning skills.
