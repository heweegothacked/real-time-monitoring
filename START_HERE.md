## 💡 Key Concepts (60 seconds)

### What does this system do?
1. **Generates** realistic sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure)
2. **Detects** anomalies (unusual readings) using AI
3. **Predicts** future values using machine learning
4. **Visualizes** everything on an interactive dashboard

### How does it work?
- **Sensor Simulator** → generates data
- **ML Model** → learns patterns and makes predictions
- **Dashboard** → shows data and predictions to users
- **You** → interact and watch it work

### What technologies?
- Python (programming)
- Pandas (data handling)
- Scikit-learn (machine learning)
- Plotly (visualizations)
- Streamlit (dashboard)

### Why is this impressive?
- Full-stack system (data → ML → web UI)
- Real machine learning (not just tutorials)
- Professional quality (documented, tested, polished)
- Beginner-friendly (clear code, comments, docs)
- Resume-worthy (shows multiple skills)
